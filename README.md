#  Gesture Recognition using Hidden Markov Models on IMU Data

## Problem Statement
Use Hidden Markov Model on IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope) to classify gestures.

## Usage Guide:
1. Run `WrapperTrainandTest.m` for running both training and testing.
2. Run `WrapperTestOnly.m` for testing only (Change TestPath as needed)
3.You'll need a folder called `Outputs` to save the plots or else the code will throw an error.

## Report:
You can find the report [here](Report/ESE650Project3.pdf).
