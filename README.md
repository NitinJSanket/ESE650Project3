ESE 650: Learning in Robotics, Project 3, Gesture Recognition using Hidden Markov Models and IMU Data

README For Running Gesture Recognition using HMM Code:
(1) Run WrapperTrainandTest.m for running both training and testing
(2) Run WrapperTestOnly.m for testing only (Change TestPath as needed)
(3) You'll need a folder called Outputs to save the plots or else the code will throw an error
